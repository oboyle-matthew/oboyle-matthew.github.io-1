                        My first and foremost priority at Duke is the continuous investment in building diverse and welcoming communities. Every step of the way I have advocated for the Duke and Durham community from being on the Centre for Race Relations Executive Board to assisting with the Duke-Durham School Days Initiative.

                        Ensuring that every student has equal opportunities to access all of Dukeâ€™s resources regardless of their background is one of the core tenets of my work as the co-President of Duke LIFE. Serving as a You @ Duke facilitator during Orientation Week was also because I believe every Duke student, from the first day they step on this campus should be considering how they can improve the experience of every member of our Duke family.

                        Being able to sit on the Undergraduate Education Committee of the Board of Trustees this past year has been one of the greatest privileges of my time at Duke. I have learned how to confidently voice my understanding of the student experience and advocate for increased awareness of students' needs at the highest level of decision making at our university.
